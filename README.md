# Sequential Modelling of the Evolution of Word Representations for Semantic Change Detection
Python code for the paper *"Sequential Modelling of the Evolution of Word Representations for Semantic Change Detection"* by Tsakalidis & Liakata (EMNLP 2020) [1]. The four folders contain the following:
- **data**: contains the data (words, labels, train/test indices) that were used in the paper;
- **models**: contains the source code for the models that were employed in the experimnents (one file per model);
- **evaluation_scripts**: functions to use for evaluating the performance of a model;
- **synthetic_data_scripts**: used for the synthetic data part of the paper (section 4 of the paper).

### Data
First, download the word vectors from this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/d9cmc8kied74hiv/AABT5z1Z67MJ7KChIXWRUvO9a?dl=0) (~250MB) and extract the *vectors.p* file within the */data/* folder. These vectors have been originally generated in [2].
